# React.js Koans

If you want to learn React.js you came to the right place. We prepared a set of practical exercises that will help you learn React.js from square one. The only thing you need to know is JavaScript. Here we are using [ECMAScript 2015 standard](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).

The Koans are a set of tasks to complete. Prepared tests checks if they are done correctly.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and Python 2 installed.

  1. `git clone https://github.com/arkency/reactjs_koans.git`
  2. `cd reactjs_koans`
  3. `npm run setup`

## Koans structure

 * Edit the files found in the **`exercises`** directory.
 * The `koans` directory contains the source of all the exercises. `test` contains the tests.
 * `src` a contains files compiled from `exercises`.
 * `build` contains sources launched in the web browser version of Koans.

## Start a local web server (optional)

You can run a webserver and see your changes live in your web browser:

  1. Run command `npm run start`
  2. Visit http://localhost:8080/

## Instructions

  1. Work on the code found in the `exercises` directory and run the tests to see if you did everything right.
  2. You need to do the exercises in the given order.
  3. Try to not peek at the test files! They contain spoilers.
  4. To run the tests, use `npm run test`. To automatically run tests when your code changes, use `npm run watch`.
